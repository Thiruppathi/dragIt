The idea is to generate Event Streams of mouseDown, mouseUp events. This eventStreamSubscription is used to track the mouse pointer's current position.\r\n\r\n## How To Install\r\n\r\nCheck out the project. Open the index.html\r\n\r\n## How To Play\r\n\r\n![dragIt](http://fritzing.org/media/fritzing-repo/projects/d/drag-it/images/dragIt.png)\r\n\r\nDrag the Green Ball towards the Green Bar at the top, without touching the side walls.\r\n\r\nYou have 3 Lives. For each wrong try(touching the side walls) a Life will be reduced. \r\n\r\nOnce you reach the top you get a Success Message.\r\n\r\n## Firebase\r\n\r\nLife Count and Success Flag are sync with [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) in realtime.\r\n\r\n## Arduino - Johnny Five Implementation\r\n\r\nJohnny Five Module polls Firebase, when the lifeCount reaches 0, the led(13) is turned off.\r\n\r\nWhen the ball reaches the target, Success Flag is set to True and Big LED(9) turns on.\r\n\r\nHere is the fritzing\r\n\r\n![fritzing-dragIt](http://i.imgur.com/oGW1Efq.png =400x600)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
